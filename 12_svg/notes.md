### Notes

#### Preliminary scanning
* You can instantiate elements (sounds OOP-y) with .enter()
* Function params can be params of functions

#### While executing
* barEnter.style() returned an object
* The dir class was able to split into 6 bars after defining barEnter
* chart is probably a chart __object__
